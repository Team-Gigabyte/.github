# ðŸ‘‹  This is Team Gigabyte.
We are a software collective based on the East Coast, working mainly with JavaScript and Python. (And Markdown, of course!)

We built the best meal planner for diabetics. [Check it out!](https://gigmeals.azurewebsites.net/)

Our first project is [Quotobot](https://github.com/Team-Gigabyte/quotobot), the Discord bot that pulls all kinds of info.

The same great quotes database that powers Quotobot is also available for *you* to use through the [Quotoserve](https://github.com/Team-Gigabyte/quotoserve) REST API.
